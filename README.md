# cwa-quicktest-php
A PHP class that simplifies the integration of the Corona Warn Aapp (CWA; Germany's official Corona virus contact tracing app) by providing the data for QR code generation and handling the communication with the cwa-testresult-server API.

## Installation

**Note**: This is still in an early stage and merely a prototype in development that has not yet been tested in production (or anywhere, really). So there's no Composer package available yet, but we plan to release this as a Composer package once it's ready and tested.
